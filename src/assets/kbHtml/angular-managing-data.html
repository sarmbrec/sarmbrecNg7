<p>
    In this section, you'll create the shopping cart. You'll:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Update the product details page to include a "Buy" button, which adds the current product to a list of products managed by a cart service.</li>
    <li>Add a cart component, which displays the items you added to your cart.</li>
    <li>Add a shipping component, which retrieves shipping prices for the items in the cart by using Angular's HttpClient to retrieve shipping data from a .json file.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Services</h3>
<p>
    Services are an integral part of Angular applications. In Angular, a service is an instance of a class that can be made available to any part of your application using Angular's dependency injection system.
</p>
<p>
    Services are the place where you share data between parts of your application. For the online store, the cart service is where you store your cart data and methods.
</p>
<h4>Create the shopping cart service</h4>
<p>Up to this point, users can view product information, and simulate sharing and being notified about product changes. They cannot, however, buy products.</p>
<p>In this section, you'll add a "Buy" button to the product details page. You'll also set up a cart service to store information about products in the cart.</p>

<p>Later, in the <a href="https://angular.io/start/forms">Forms</a> part of this tutorial, this cart service also will be accessed from the page where the user checks out.</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Generate a cart service.</p>
        <ul type="a">
            <li>
                <p>Right click on the app folder, choose Angular Generator, and choose Service. Name the new service cart.</p>
                <code>
                    import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';<br><br>
                    @Injectable({<br>
                        providedIn: 'root'<br>
                    })<br>
                    export class CartService {<br><br>                    
                        constructor() {}<br><br>                    
                    }
                </code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the generated @Injectable() decorator does not include the { providedIn: 'root' } statement, then insert it as shown above.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>In the CartService class, define an items property to store the list (array) of the current products in the cart.</p>
        <code>
        export class CartService {<br>
            items = [];<br>
        }<br>
        </code>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Define methods to add items to the cart, return cart items, and clear the cart items:</p>
        <code>
            export class CartService {<br>
                items = [];<br><br>                
                addToCart(product) {<br>
                    this.items.push(product);<br>
                }<br><br>                
                getItems() {<br>
                    return this.items;<br>
                }<br><br>                
                clearCart() {<br>
                    this.items = [];<br>
                    return this.items;<br>
                }<br>
            }
        </code>
    </li>
</ol>
